# Time Series Analysis

The goal of this project is time-series forecasting using state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).

In the first phase of the project, these forecasting algorithms are applied to synthetic datasets designed with specific seasonality and trend components, as well as structured (non-random) noise. In the second phase, a real-world problem is addressed: predicting Bitcoin prices over time, to evaluate the modelsâ€™ ability to accurately forecast real-world time-series data.
